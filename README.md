# R for Applied Statistics & Data Analysis
This repository is a curated portfolio of projects demonstrating my applied skills in **statistical analysis, modeling, and data science** using R. The projects cover the full data workflow—from importing and cleaning data to advanced statistical modeling and visualization—reflecting methodologies commonly used in research and data-driven decision making.

## Core Statistical Competencies Demonstrated
The projects in this repository provide hands-on experience in the following key areas:
*   **Statistical Modeling & Regression Analysis:** Implementation of linear regression models to analyze relationships between variables (`Regression.R`).
*   **Multivariate Analysis:** Application of **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** for dimensionality reduction and data exploration (`PrincipalComponents.R`).
*   **Hypothesis Testing & Inference:** Foundational work with descriptive statistics and data summarization that underpins formal hypothesis testing (`Describe.R`, `Summary.R`).
*   **Experimental Design & Data Wrangling:** Techniques for selecting cases, handling factors, and structuring data to prepare for robust statistical testing (`SelectingCases.R`, `Factors.R`, `Tidyverse.R`).
*   **Data Visualization for Communication:** Creating insightful visualizations like histograms, scatterplots, and bar charts to communicate data patterns and model results (`Histograms.R`, `Scatterplots.R`, `BarCharts.R`).

## Project Highlights & Methodologies
| Project File | Key Statistical Methods Demonstrated | Relevance to Applied Fields |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`Regression.R`** | **Linear Regression, Model Fitting, Interpretation of Coefficients** | Econometrics, Biostatistics, Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) foundation |
| **`PrincipalComponents.R`** | **Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Dimensionality Reduction** | Data compression, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering for ML |
| **`HierarchicalClustering.R`** | **Unsupervised Learning, Cluster Analysis** | Machine Learning (Clustering), customer/patient segmentation |
| **`Histograms.R` & `Scatterplots.R`** | **Data Distribution Analysis, Relationship Visualization** | Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), a critical first step in any statistical modeling or hypothesis testing workflow |
| **`Tidyverse.R`** | **Data Manipulation (`dplyr`), Tidying Data (`tidyr`)** | Reproducible research, data cleaning for Applied Statistics and Biostatistics |

## Getting Started
To explore these analyses:
1.  Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/eugenius-watchman/r-data-analysis-projects.git`
2.  Open the `.R` files in RStudio. Each script is self-contained and demonstrates a specific statistical concept or task.

## Requirements
*   R (>= 4.0.0)
*   Core packages used: `tidyverse` (for data wrangling and grammar of graphics), `ggplot2` (for advanced plotting). Install with `install.packages(c("tidyverse", "ggplot2"))`.

*This portfolio showcases practical application of statistical theory. The code is structured for clarity and learning, mirroring professional data analysis workflows.*

## Full Project Inventory
This repository contains additional scripts and datasets that support the core competencies outlined above, including data import/export (`ImportingData.R`), foundational plotting (`Plot.R`), and workspace management.
